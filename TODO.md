# TODO

- Allow changing default view mode / sort order

- Make thumbnail loading not fatal

- If an image fails to load while we were going forwards/backwards, we should continue trying to go forwards/backwards

- Option to not trust extensions

- Option to load all the image kinds in the background

- Getting an error from an entry should somehow automatically remove it from the list

- Create some wrapper to generate the 4 `<field>_blocking`, `<field>_load`, `<field>_if_loaded` and `<field>_is_loaded` automatically.
