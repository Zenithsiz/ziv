# TODO

- Allow changing default view mode / sort order

- Make thumbnail loading not fatal

- If an image fails to load while we were going forwards/backwards, we should continue trying to go forwards/backwards

- Option to not trust extensions

- Option to load all the image kinds in the background

- Getting an error from an entry should somehow automatically remove it from the list

- When removing entries, the current entry's index doesn't get updated
